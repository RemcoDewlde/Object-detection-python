## prerequisites:
* Python 3
* Pip 3
* Wget
* Cup of coffee


## Mac and Linux quick start:
For a quick start use the bash script below.

```bash
bash install.sh
```
It will update Pip and installs the packages we use in the project. It will also get the weights file needed for the object detection as we cannot push it to github (Its over **100MB!**)
<br>
## Windows quick start:
Well... ehhh, good luck. You can maybe try the linux sub-system for windows and run the command, but otherwise we do not have a quickstart script for windows.
<br>
## Starting the python script:
Starting the python script use the following command.

````bash
python main.py
````
##Controlls:
**There are the following commands:**

* To quit use: ``q ``

When the quit key is pressed the programe will close and display the seconds the program has run and the average fps.
If closed using ``command + c `` on Mac or ``ctrl + c`` on Windows and Linux.
